Clockwork - a Front-End Exercise
================================

This is an exercise for aspiring front-end developers
to apply understandings of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery
for a practical purpose - layering information 
(hour, minute, second).

Inspiration
------------

[Episode 583](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/583/transcript) of [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) includes a segment about
a man with a scientific background suffering from dementia. 
This story has stuck with me for a while because the man became
equal parts fascinated and frustrated by the difficulty of telling
time from an analog clock.

The segment explains how this is a common challenge for elderly 
people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's because it involves
simultaneously processing three layers of information.

This exercise has given me a better appreciation of clocks and 
I hope it will inspire others to develop their own alternative
clocks.
